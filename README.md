# What's New?

This simple news application was built with `create-react-app` to display previews of news stories with links to the full articles. Users can filter news by Local, Technology, Entertainment, Science or Health topics. Users can also search for articles in each topic.

## Learning Goals
- Write clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax and readable JSX
- Pass information between components using props
- Use `propTypes` for every component receiving props
- Unit test React components including smoke testing, methods, and changes in state

## Set Up

1. Clone/download this repo
2. Run `npm install` then `npm start`
3. Open localhost:3000 in your favorite browser (this may happen automatically)
